Four-Space Visualization of 4D Objects
========================================

This repository contains my thesis (converted to HTML from the original nroff
sources), as well as the original code for my 4D wireframe viewer and my 4D
raytracer.

The 4D wireframe viewer - wire4 - was written to run on an SGI Iris workstation.
It reads in arbitrary 4D wireframes from a simple text file and displays them
interactively. The code has not been maintained, though, and will not run on
most modern computers.

My 4D raytracer - ray4 - is written in standard C, and reads from and writes to
standard output, so should be able to run on most computers. The output is a 3D
RGB image that can be displayed with a variety of methods.
