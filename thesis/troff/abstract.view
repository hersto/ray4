9                   In the field of scientific visualization, the term

               ``four dimensional visualization'' usually refers to the

               process of rendering a three dimensional field of scalar

               values.  While this paradigm applies to many different data

               sets, there are also uses for visualizing data that

               correspond to actual four-dimensional structure.  Four di-

               mensional structures have typically been visualized via

               wireframe methods, but this process alone is usually insuf-

               ficient for an intuitive understanding; all but the most

               simple datasets easily overwhelm the viewer.  This research

               covers the visualization of four dimensional objects through

               wireframe methods with extended visualization cues, and

               through raytracing methods.  Both the wireframe and raytrac-

               ing methods employ true four-space viewing parameters and

               geometry.  The raytracing approach easily solves the hidden

               surface and shadowing problems of 4D objects, and yields an

               image in the form of a three-dimensional field of RGB

               values, which can be rendered with a variety of existing

               methods.  The 4D raytracer also supports true four-

               dimensional lighting, reflections and refractions.

                                     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

9                   In appreciation of the time, effort and patience extend-

               ed to me in the pursuit of this thesis, I would like to

               thank my committee chairman, Dr. Thomas Foley.  In addition

               to his guidance in the topic of this research, he has also

               been unfailing in helping me get the resources and informa-

               tion I needed to complete both this research and this paper.

               I would also like to acknowledge and thank Dr. Gregory Niel-

               son and Dr.  Gerald Farin for being on my thesis committee

               and offering their observations and suggestions.

                   Thanks are also due to Kevin Price for letting me use

               his Amiga and helping me produce animations of the raytrace

               data that aided my understanding of the process and nature

               of four-dimensional raytracing.

                   Finally, I would like to thank my family for their pati-

               ence, confidence, enthusiasm and financial support.
