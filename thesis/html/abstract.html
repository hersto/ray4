<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p style="text-indent: 0;">
In the field of scientific visualization, the term &quot;four dimensional
visualization&quot; usually refers to the process of rendering a three
dimensional field of scalar values. While this paradigm applies to many
different data sets, there are also uses for visualizing data that correspond
to actual four-dimensional structures. Four dimensional structures have
typically been visualized via wireframe methods, but this process alone is
usually insufficient for an intuitive understanding; all but the most simple
datasets easily overwhelm the viewer. This research covers the visualization
of four dimensional objects through wireframe methods with extended
visualization cues, and through raytracing methods. Both the wireframe and
raytracing methods employ true four-space viewing parameters and geometry.
The raytracing approach easily solves the hidden surface and shadowing
problems of 4D objects, and yields an image in the form of a three-dimensional
field of RGB values, which can be rendered with a variety of existing methods.
The 4D raytracer also supports true four-dimensional lighting, reflections and
refractions.
