<h2 id="s4.1">4.1  High-Level Overview of 4D to 2D Projection</h2>

<p class="noindent">
Projection from four-space to a two-space region involves an additional
projection compared to the usual display of three-dimensional wireframe data.
Both the 3D projection and the additional 4D projection can be governed by
independent sets of viewing parameters.

<p>The first step of the 4D wireframe display process is to project the 4D
vertices from four-space to an intermediate three-dimensional region.  This
projection uses the four dimensional viewing parameters discussed in
<a href="chapter3.html#s3.2">section 3.2</a>,
and can be either a perspective projection or a parallel projection.

<p>The next step is to take the projected vertices (now in three-space) and
project them once more to the 2D viewport rectangle.  This projection is
determined by the three dimensional viewing parameters presented in
<a href="chapter3.html#s3.1">section 3.1</a>,
and can also be either parallel or perspective.  Once the vertices
have been projected to screen coordinates, each edge of the wireframe is
displayed.

<h2 id="s4.2">4.2  Description of 3D to 2D Projection</h2>

<p class="noindent">
There are several methods of projecting three-space points to a
two-dimensional viewport.  The method used and extended for this research is
found in <a href="ref.html#Foley87">[Foley 87]</a>, and involves a
vector subtraction and a multiplication between a 3-vector and a 3x3 matrix
for each projected point.

<p>The first step in projecting a 3D point is to convert its absolute
&ldquo;world&rdquo; coordinates to viewer-relative &ldquo;eye&rdquo;
coordinates. In the left-handed eye coordinate system, the eye-point is at the
origin, the line-of-sight corresponds to the Z axis, the up-vector corresponds
to the Y axis, and the X axis is orthogonal to the resulting Y and Z axes.
Refer to figure 4.1 for a diagram of the eye-coordinate system.

<p><div class="figure" align="center"><a name="fig4.1">
    <img src="images/fig41.gif"
         alt="Figure 4.1"
         width="500" height="251"
         border="4">
    <br>Figure 4.1<br>3D Eye Coordinates
</a></div>

<p>
To convert a 3D point to 3D eye coordinates, one must first establish the
vector from the eye-coordinate origin to the point by subtracting the
from-point from the 3D vertex.  Then the vector difference is rotated so that
the to-point lies on the Z axis of the eye-coordinate system, and the
up-vector lies on the Y axis.  This is accomplished by multiplying the vector
difference by the transformation matrix.  The 3x3 transformation matrix has
column vectors A, B and C, where A, B and C correspond to the X, Y, and Z axes
in eye coordinates, respectively.  The equations for these vectors are
<pre>
              To - From
        C = -------------,
            ||To - From||

              Up x C
        A = ----------, and
            ||Up x C||

        B = C x A,
</pre>
where To is the to-point, From is the from-point, Up is the
up-vector, and the original world coordinates are supplied in the left-handed
coordinate system.  For the right-handed coordinate system, the cross product
order for column vectors A and B would be reversed.

<p>The procedure for computing the transformation matrix is given in the
following algorithm.  Note that Norm3(V) returns the vector norm of the
3-vector parameter V, and Cross3(U,V,W) assigns to U the 3-vector cross
product of the parameter vectors V and W.
<pre>
    // The parameters a, b and c are the resulting transformation matrix
    // column vectors.

    void Calc3Matrix (
        Point3   From,      // Looking From This Point
        Point3   To,        // Point of Interest
        Vector3  Up,        // Direction Up
        Vector3 *Va,        // Return Vector A
        Vector3 *Vb,        // Return Vector B
        Vector3 *Vc)        // Return Vector C
    {
        // Get the normalized Vc column-vector.

        VecSub (Vc, To, From);
        norm = Norm3 (Vc);
        if (norm == 0)
            Error ("To point and From point are the same.");
        VecScale (Vc, 1/norm);

        // Calculate the normalized Va column-vector.

        VecCross3 (Va, Vc, Up3);
        norm = Norm3 (Va);
        if (norm == 0)
            Error ("Up is parallel to the line of sight.");
        VecScale (Va, 1/norm);

        // Calculate the Vb column-vector.

        Cross3 (Vb, Va, Vc);
    }
</pre>

Once the A, B and C vectors (corresponding to Va, Vb and Vc in the
pseudo-code above) are calculated, all 3D points can be transformed from 3D
world coordinates to 3D eye coordinates as follows:
<pre>
                                   +-        -+
                                   | Ax Bx Cx |
    P' = [(Px-Fx) (Py-Fy) (Pz-Fz)] | Ay By Cy |
                                   | Az Bz Cz |
                                   +-        -+
</pre>

where Fx, Fy and Fz are the X, Y and Z coordinates of the from-point,
P is the original data point in 3D world coordinates, and P' is the
transformed data point in eye coordinates.

<p>We can now use the resulting 3D eye coordinates to project the 3D points to
a two-dimensional rectangle.  What we want is a projection that maps 3D points
that lie in the 3D viewing frustum to the [-1,+1] x [-1,+1] rectangle.
This rectangle will later be mapped to the viewport on the display device.

<p>The projection from three-space to the 2D rectangle can be either a
parallel projection or a perspective projection.

<p>Parallel projection maps objects to the viewport in such a way that distant
objects appear the same size as near objects.  This is the effect that you'd
get if the eye-point was infinitely far away from the object to be viewed.  In
the simple case where the projection plane is parallel to the XY plane,
parallel projection can be achieved by dropping the Z coordinate (this is the
case for eye coordinates).  Scaling the projection to fit the [-1,+1] x
[-1,+1] rectangle makes it easy to project the image to the viewport.

<p>Perspective projection is the more natural of the two projections.  With
perspective projection, objects that are far away appear smaller than objects
that are near.  In the simple case, perspective projection is achieved by
dividing by the Z coordinate.  Perspective projection should map all data
points that lie in the viewing frustum to the [-1,+1] x [-1,+1] rectangle.

<p>When using parallel projection, the equation of the data point's normalized
screen coordinates (from eye coordinates) is given by the following pair
of equations:
<pre>
             P'x                P'y        <a name="e4.2a">[4.2a]</a>
        Tx = ---    and    Ty = ---,
             R3                 R3
</pre>

where P' is the 3D point in eye coordinates, R3 is the radius of the set of
3D points centered at the 3D to-point, and T is the 2D parallel projection of
P' to the [-1,+1] x [-1,+1] rectangle.  Dividing by R3 ensures that the
parallel projection fills the viewport as much as possible without extending
past the viewport boundaries.
<p>
For the perspective projection of point P', consider figure 4.2.

<p><div class="figure" align="center"><a name="fig4.2">
    <img src="images/fig42.gif"
         alt="Figure 4.2"
         width=400
         height=300
         border=4>
    <br>Figure 4.2
    <br>3D Perspective Projection in Eye Coordinates
</a></div>

<p>
To calculate the perspective projection of point P', we need to project the
point to the viewplane and then to normalize the values so that points on the
Z axis are projected to X (or Y) = 0, and so that the values of X (or Y) range
from -1 to +1.  The X axis value from figure 4.2 is calculated by noting that
P'x/P'z = T'x/T'z.  We can let T'z = 1 if the viewing angle is still
preserved.  Thus, T'x = P'x/P'z.  To normalize T'x, note that the maximum
possible value of T'x on the viewing plane occurs at T'x/T'z = tan(theta3/2),
or T'x = tan(theta3/2).  Thus, the equations for the normalized perspective
projection T are given by

<pre>
                P'x                               P'y           <a name="e4.2b">[4.2b]</a>
    Tx = -----------------     and     Ty = -----------------
         P'z tan(theta3/2)                  P'z tan(theta3/2)
</pre>

where theta3 is the 3D viewing angle and T is the normalized perspective
projection of P' to the [-1,+1] x [-1,+1] rectangle.  Note that in the
equations presented in this chapter, the viewport is assumed to be square, so
the viewing angle for the horizontal plane and the viewing angle for the
vertical plane are the same.  This assumption will also be held and extended
for the 4D to 3D projection covered later.

<p>Now that we have the points in the [-1,+1] x [-1,+1] rectangle, we'll need
to map them to the viewport on the display device.  This viewport is specified
by the parameters

<dl>
<dt>Cx, Cy</dt><dd>The viewport center, in screen coordinates, and</dd>
<dt>Lx, Ly</dt>
<dd>The horizonal &amp; vertical length of the viewport, in screen
coordinates.</dd>
</dl>

Given these viewport parameters, the mapping of the point T in the [-1,+1]
x [-1,+1] rectangle to the display device viewport is given by the following
equations:

<pre>
                  Lx                         Ly          <a name="e4.2c">[4.2c]</a>
        Sx = Cx + ---Tx,    <i>and</i>    Sy = Cy + ---Ty.
                   2                          2
</pre>

Putting this all together, we get the following algorithm.  Note that
the function <tt>Dot3(U,V)</tt> returns the dot product of the two 3-vector
parameters <tt>U</tt> and <tt>V</tt>.
<pre>
    int      NumVerts;  // Number of 3D Vertices
    double   Radius;    // Radius of Vertices About the To3 Point
    Vector3  Va,Vb,Vc;  // Viewing-Transformation Column Vectors
    Radians  Vangle;    // 3D Viewing Angle
    Vertex3 *VertList;  // The Set of 3D Vertices

    void ProjectToScreen (
        float Cx, float Cy,
        float Lx, float Ly,
        ProjectionType proj_type)
    {
        double  S, T;    // Divisor Values
        Vector3 V;       // Scratch Vector

        if (proj_type == PARALLEL)
            S = 1 / Radius;
        else
            T = 1 / tan (Vangle / 2);

        for (i=0;  i &lt; NumVerts;  ++i) {
            V = VertList[i].Position - From;

            if (proj_type == PERSPECTIVE)
                S = T / Dot3 (V, Vc);

            VertList[i].Screen[x] = Cx + (Lx * S * Dot3 (V, Va));
            VertList[i].Screen[y] = Cy + (Ly * S * Dot3 (V, Vb));
        }
    }
</pre>



<h2 id="s4.3">4.3  Description of 4D to 3D Projection</h2>

<p class="noindent">
In this section, we extend the ideas and equations presented in section 4.2
to cover the projection of points from four-space to the intermediate 3D
region.

<p>It is possible to combine the 4D to 3D and 3D to 2D projections into a
single step, but this approach lacks the flexibility of the following two-step
approach.  The two-step approach allows the user to independently specify
viewing parameters for each projection, and to view the 3D projection from
different angles while maintaining a constant 4D view.

<p>Since the 4D to 2D projection takes place in two discrete steps, we'll need
to specify an intermediate 3D region for the projection to 3D coordinates.
For this research, the unit cube (edge length two) centered at the origin,
with vertices &lt;&#177;1, &#177;1, &#177;1&gt; was chosen as the intermediate
region.

<p>As in the 3D to 2D projections, the 4D data points can be projected to 3D
space with either a perspective projection or a parallel projection.  Neither of
these projections are more &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; than the other, but a
perspective projection will yield smaller 3D line segments for edges that are
farther from the 4D viewpoint.  As an example of the differences between these
projections, see <a href="#s4.6">section 4.6</a>.

<p>Changing the 3D projection type between perspective and parallel projection
does not produce as dramatic (or puzzling) a change as for the 4D projection.
However, switching back and forth can also provide a bit more understanding of
the 4D-projected object.

<p>The projection from 4D to 3D needs to be clipped at a minimum against the
W=0 eye-coordinate plane.  If both vertices have negative W eye-coordinate
components, the edge should not be displayed.  If both vertices have
non-negative W components, then the edge can be displayed normally.  If only
one of the two vertices of a given edge has a negative W component, then the
edge needs to be clipped to the W plane.  This can be done by finding the
intersection of the edge with the W plane and setting the vertex with the
negative W component to the intersection point.

<p>Since the 4D edges are projected to an arbitrary 3D region, it is not
critical that they be clipped against the 4D viewing frustum.  Edges that lie
outside of the viewing frustum will lie outside the 3D region.

<p>The first step of the 4D to 3D projection is to transform the vertices from
their 4D world coordinates to the 4D eye coordinates.  Refer to figure 4.3 for
an illustration of the 4D eye coordinates.

<p><div class="figure" align="center"><a name="fig4.3">
    <img src="images/fig43.gif"

         border=4>
    <br>Figure 4.3
    <br>4D Eye Coordinates
</a></div>

<p>
As in the 3D to 2D projection, this transformation is accomplished with a
transformation matrix.  The 4D viewing transformation matrix is composed of
the column vectors A, B, C and D, which correspond to the X, Y, Z and W
eye-coordinate axes, respectively.  The equations for these column vectors
are

<pre>
              To - From
        D = -------------,
            ||To - From||

              X<sub>4</sub>(Up,Over,D)
        A = -----------------,
            ||X<sub>4</sub>(Up,Over,D)||

              X<sub>4</sub>(Over,D,A)
        B = ----------------, and
            ||X<sub>4</sub>(Over,D,A)||

        C = X<sub>4</sub>(D,A,B)
</pre>

where To is the to-point, From is the from-point, Up is the up-vector, and
Over is the Over vector (all of which reside in four-space).

<p>The routine to calculate the four-dimensional transformation matrix
follows.

<pre>
    // Calc4Matrix calculates the four-dimensional viewing transformation
    // matrix and places the resulting 4x4 matrix column vectors in
    // Wa, Wb, Wc, and Wd.

    Point4  From, To;    // 4D From and To Points
    Vector4 Up, Over;    // 4D Up and Over Vectors

    void  Calc4Matrix  (
        Vector4 *Wa,
        Vector4 *Wb,
        Vector4 *Wc,
        Vector4 *Wd)
    {
        double norm;    // Vector Norm

        // Get the normalized Wd column-vector.

        VecSub (Wd, To, From);
        norm = Norm4 (*Wd);
        if (norm == 0)
            Error ("To point and From point are the same.");
        VecScale (Wd, 1/norm);

        // Calculate the normalized Wa column-vector.

        Cross4 (Wa, Up,Over,*Wd);
        norm = Norm4 (Wa);
        if (norm == 0)
            Error ("Invalid Up vector.");
        VecScale (Wa, 1/norm);

        // Calculate the normalized Wb column-vector.

        Cross4 (Wb, Over, *Wd, *Wa);
        norm = Norm4 (Wb);
        if (norm == 0)
            Error ("Invalid Over vector.");
        VecScale (Wb, 1/norm);

        // Calculate the Wc column-vector.

        Cross4 (Wc, *Wd, *Wa, *Wb);
    }
</pre>
The 4x4 matrix composed of these column vectors transforms the 4D
world coordinates to 4D eye coordinates.  The full transformation is given
by the following product:
<pre>
                                               +-           -+
                                               | Ax Bx Cx Dx |
        V' = [(Vx-Fx) (Vy-Fy) (Vz-Fz) (Vw-Fw)] | Ay By Cy Dy |,
                                               | Az Bz Cz Dz |
                                               | Aw Bw Cw Dw |
                                               +-           -+
</pre>
where Fx, Fy, Fz and Fw are the coordinates of the from-point and Vx, Vy,
Vz and Vw are the 4D world coordinates of the vertex.  This equation yields
the 4D eye-coordinates of the vertex:  V'.

<p>Now that the vertices have been transformed from 4D world coordinates to 4D
eye coordinates, we can project them to the normalized [-1,+1] x [-1,+1] x
[-1,+1] region in three-space.  As for the 3D to 2D case, this projection can
be either parallel or perspective.  The equations for these projections are
extensions of equations <a href="#e4.2a">4.2a</a> and <a href="#e4.2b">4.2b</a>.

<p>The equations for parallel 4D to 3D projection are extended from equation
<a href="#e4.2a">4.2a</a> by one coordinate:

<pre>
             V'x          V'y              V'z        <a name="e4.3a">[4.3a]</a>
        Qx = ---,    Qy = ---, and    Qz = ---,
             R4           R4               R4
</pre>

where R4 is the radius of the set of 4D vertices about the to-point.
Dividing by this radius ensures that the vertices are projected to fill the
intermediate region as much as possible without extending past the
boundaries.

<p>In equation <a href="#e4.2b">4.2b</a>, the X and Y eye coordinates are
divided by the Z eye coordinate to yield the perspective projection.  In the 4D
to 3D perspective projection, this &ldquo;depth&rdquo; is similarly achieved by
dividing by the W eye coordinate (which corresponds to the four-dimensional
line-of-sight).

<p><div class="figure" align="center"><a name="fig4.4">

         width=400 height=300 border=4>
    <br>Figure 4.4
    <br>4D Perspective Projection in Eye Coordinates
</a></div>

<p>
Figure 4.4 contains a diagram of the 4D normalized
perspective projection.  The derivation of the normalized 4D perspective
projection follows the same reasoning as for the 3D normalized perspective
projection.  The equations are

<pre>
    <a name="e4.3b">[4.3b]</a>
                             V'x         V'y             V'z
    T = tan(theta4/2), Qx = -----, Qy = -----, and Qz = -----.
                            V'w T       V'w T           V'w T
</pre>

where theta4 is the 4D viewing angle.  These equations yield values in the
range of [-1,+1] for vertices that lie in the 4D viewing frustum.

<p>Mapping the projected points to a viewbox in three-space can be
accomplished in the same manner that we mapped normalized 2D coordinates to
the 2D viewport.  Given the viewbox parameters

<dl style="margin-left: 2em;">
    <p><dt>Bx, By, Bz</dt><dd>The center of the viewbox region, and</dd>
    <p><dt>Dx, Dy, Dz</dt><dd>The length of the viewbox sides,</dd>
</dl>

we can map the normalized 3D coordinates to the viewbox with the following
equations:

<pre>
              Dx                 Dy                     Dz         <a name="e4.3c">[4.3c]</a>
    Px = Bx + -- Qx,   Py = By + -- Qy, and   Pz = Bz + -- Qz.
              2                  2                      2
</pre>

As mentioned earlier, the intermediate 3D region used in this research is
the cube with vertices &lt;&#177;1, &#177;1, &#177;1&gt;, centered at the
three-space origin.  For this particular region, Bx = By = Bz = 0, and
Lx = Ly = Lz = 2, so the simplified equations are

<pre>
             V'x          V'y              V'z
        Px = ---,    Py = ---, and    Pz = ---.
             R4           R4               R4
</pre>

for 4D to 3D parallel projection, and

<pre>
        T = tan (theta4/2)

              V'x         V'y             V'z
        Px = -----, Py = -----, and Pz = -----.
             V'w T       V'w T           V'w T
</pre>

for 4D to 3D perspective projection.

<p>The routine to project the four-dimensional vertices to the
three-dimensional region is given by the following algorithm (the algorithm
presented here does not perform any type of 4D clipping):

<pre>
    double   Radius;      // Radius of the 4D Vertices
    int      NumVerts;    // Number of Vertices
    Radians  Vangle;      // 4D Viewing Angle
    Point4  *VertList;    // Vertex Array
    Vector4  Wa,Wb,Wc,Wd; // 4D Transformation Matrix Column Vectors

<h2 id="s4.4">4.4  Rotations of 4D Wireframes</h2>

<p class="noindent"> Rotation of the 4D wireframe is a tremendous aid in
understanding the fundamental structure of the displayed object.  This rotation
is best done by tying the rotation input to mouse movement.  The wireframe
program written for this research uses the horizontal movement of the mouse
only.  Restricting the rotation input to a single plane helps only somewhat for
three-space rotation, but greatly helps with four-space rotations, where it's
more difficult to figure out how to &ldquo;undo&rdquo; a particular pair of
rotations of the four-space viewpoint.

<p>Rotating the view of the object can be accomplished by rotating the
viewpoint, rather than rotating each of the object vertices.  This way, it
isn't necessary to rotate all of the wireframe vertices; you only have to
rotate the viewpoint.  For rotation in three-space, use the regular 3D
rotation matrices, and for rotating in four-space, use the
<a href="chapter2.html#rotmats">rotation matrices</a>
presented in section 2.2.  Another way to describe this is to say that the 3D
(or 4D) from-point is moved over a three- (or four-) sphere.

<p>When rotating the three-space view, you don't need to recompute the 4D to
3D projections; it's more efficient to save the projected 3D vertices and to
recompute only the 3D to screen projections.  The main steps for rotating the
3D viewpoint are:

<p><ol>
<li>Rotate the 3D from-point about the 3D to-point in some plane.</li>
<li>Recalculate the 3D viewing transformation matrix.</li>
<li>Project all 3D points to viewport coordinates.</li>
<li>Display each wireframe edge.</li>
</ol>

<p>
When rotating the four-space viewpoint, you also need to recompute the 4D
to 3D projection.  The main steps for rotating the 4D viewpoint are:

<p><ol>
<li>Rotate the 4D viewpoint about the 4D to-point in some plane.</li>
<li>Recalculate the 4D viewing transformation matrix.</li>
<li>Project all 4D points to the 3D cube space.</li>
<li>Project all 3D points to viewport coordinates.</li>
<li>Display each wireframe edge.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="s4.5">4.5  User Interaction and Visualization Aids</h2>

<p class="noindent">
User interaction for the wireframe program should include several
options to allow the user to experiment with the displayed
object.  One of the most important of these options is the
interactive rotation of the object mentioned above, but there
are several other options that increase the understanding of the
wireframe object.

<p>The user should be able to switch between perspective and parallel projection
of the wireframe for both the 4D to 3D projection and the 3D to viewport
projection.  Switching from parallel projection to perspective projection
sometimes gives the user a better idea of the object's perspective.

<p>Another aid is the display of both the 3D and the 4D coordinate axes.  This
display aids the user in orienting the object with the 3D or 4D world, and
also helps the user to choose the desired object rotation; this is especially
helpful when trying to choose four-space rotations.

<p>Displaying the edges of the &lt;&#177;1, &#177;1, &#177;1&gt; cube
(the intermediate three-dimensional projection space) along with the object
helps the user to select the proper 3D and 4D viewing parameters in order to
best fill the intermediate 3D cube and 2D viewport.  It also helps the user to
identify rotations in four-space versus rotations in three-space without
looking away from the object display.

<p>Finally, a useful four-dimensional visual aid is the depthcueing of the
wireframe according to the four-dimensional depth of each vertex.  In normal
three-dimensional depthcueing, the Z eye-coordinate is used to assign an
intensity to the vertex.  Edges are then shaded by linearly interpolating the
intensities of the two endpoint vertices.  Typically, vertices that are
farther from the viewpoint are rendered with a lower intensity, and vertices
closer to the viewpoint are rendered with greater intensity, so edges dim in
intensity as they extend away from the viewer.

<p>This analogy extends quite nicely to four-dimensional wireframes; the
&ldquo;depth&rdquo; of a vertex is simply the 4D W eye-coordinate.  As an
example, when the four-cube is rendered with 4D depthcueing, the
&ldquo;inner&rdquo; cube is shaded with a lower intensity than the
&ldquo;outer&rdquo; cube, since it is farther away in four-dimensional space.



<h2 id="s4.6">4.6  Example 4D Wireframe Images</h2>

<p class="noindent"> In figures 4.5a through 4.5d, the hypercube with vertices
of &lt;&#177;1, &#177;1, &#177;1, &#177;1&gt; is rendered with 4D parallel
&amp; perspective and 3D parallel &amp; perspective projections.  The
four-cube is displayed with the following viewing parameters:

<pre>
    From4  = &lt;4, 0, 0, 0&gt; 
    To4    = &lt;0, 0, 0, 0&gt; 
    Up4    = &lt;0, 1, 0, 0&gt; 
    Over4  = &lt;0, 0, 1, 0&gt; 
    theta4 = 45 degrees
    From3  = &lt;3.00, 0.99, 1.82&gt; 
    To3    = &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;
    Up3    = &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;
    theta3 = 45 degrees
</pre>

</a></div>

<p> In figure <a href="#fig4.5a">4.5a</a>, the &ldquo;inner&rdquo; cube is
actually farther away in four-space than the &ldquo;outer&rdquo; cube, and hence
appears smaller in the resulting projection.  You can think of the larger cube
as the &ldquo;front face&rdquo; of the four-cube, and the the smaller cube as
the &ldquo;rear face&rdquo; of the four-cube.  When rotating the four-cube in
the proper plane, the rear face gradually swings to the front, and the front
face gradually swings to the rear.  In doing this, the cube appears to turn
itself inside out, so that the originally smaller cube engulfs the previously
larger cube.

<p>In figure <a href="#fig4.5c">4.5c</a>, the four-cube is displayed with 4D
parallel projection and 3D perspective projection.  Because of the parallel
projection from 4D, the &ldquo;rear face&rdquo; and &ldquo;front face&rdquo; are
displayed as the same size, so the parallel projection from this point in
four-space looks like two identically-sized three-cubes superimposed over each
other.

<p>Figures <a href="#fig4.6a">4.6a</a> through <a href="#fig4.6d">4.6d</a>
are similar to figures <a href="#fig4.5a">4.5a</a> through
<a href="#fig4.5d">4.5d</a>, except
that the four-dimensional viewpoint has changed.  For these views, the
four-dimensional viewing parameters are:

<pre>
    From4  = &lt;2.83, 2.83, .01, 0&gt;
    To4    = &lt;0, 0, 0, 0&gt;
    Up4    = &lt;-.71, .71, 0, 0&gt;
    Over4  = &lt;0, 0, 1, .02&gt;
    theta4 = 45 degrees
    From3  = &lt;3.29, .68, 1.4&gt;
    To3    = &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;
    Up3    = &lt;.08, 1, .04&gt;
    theta3 = 45 degrees

This vantage point occurs one eighth of the way though a complete
four-dimensional rotation.  See figure 4.7a for an illustration of this
rotation.

<p>
Figure 4.7a shows the sequence of one fourth of a four-dimensional rotation
of the hypercube (read the sequence from top to bottom, left to right) with 4D
and 3D perspective projection.  Figure 4.7b shows the
same sequence with 4D parallel and 3D perspective projection.

<p>
In figure <a href="#fig4.9">4.9</a>, the dual of the four-cube is rendered
with all edges rendered the same color.  The dual of the four-cube is the
wireframe of convex hull of the face centers of the four-cube.  In other words,
the convex hull of the points &lt;&#177;1, 0, 0, 0&gt;,
&lt;0, &#177;1, 0, 0&gt;, &lt;0, 0, &#177;1, 0&gt;, and
&lt;0, 0, 0, &#177;1&gt;.  One could also think of it as the four-dimensional
analog of the three-dimensional octahedron.

<p>
Figures <a href="#fig4.8">4.8</a> through <a href="#fig4.13">4.13</a>
illustrate the differences in single edge-color
rendering, multiple edge-color rendering, and depth-cued edge rendering.  Even
with interactive manipulation of the four-dimensional wireframe, single
edge-color rendering yields an image that is difficult to interpret.
Assigning different colors to the edges greatly aids the user in identifying
sub-structures of the four-dimensional wireframe, and serves as a structural
reference when rotating the object.  Depth-cueing the edges gives a spatial
sense of the object, but loses the structural cues.
