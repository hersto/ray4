<h1>Chapter 6
    <br>Conclusion
</h1>

<p class="noindent">
The previous chapters explored two approaches to the task of rendering
four-dimensional images:  wireframe display and raytracing.  Both techniques
have advantages and disadvantages over the other; <i>e.g.</i> wireframe
display is the only real solution to rendering four-space curves.  It also
allows for rapid display of a four-dimensional structure.

<p>Raytracing, on the other hand, allows the user to view surfaces and solids
in and of four dimensions.  It also provides other important visual cues, such
as shadows, highlights, and reflections.  In addition, the output images make
it clear which parts are solids projected from four-space; the wireframe
approach is subject to ambiguity in the projected image.

<h2 id="s6.1">6.1 Research Conclusions</h2>

<p class="noindent">
This research began with the goal of visualizing four-dimensional
structures in four dimensions.  While several techniques exist (and
many more are currently being developed) to visualize four dimensional
data as 3D scalar fields, there are few techniques that exist to
visualize four-space geometry.

<p>There are, in fact, several 4D wireframe display programs; the earliest
documented was written around 1967.  The wireframe display program presented
in this paper combines the wireframe display with the viewing model presented
in <a href="ref.html#Foley87">[Foley 87]</a>, which is a simple and
efficient method of projection.  In addition, the program written for this
research allows for the 4D depth-cueing of the display data, the interactive
manipulation of the 4D object, and the interactive selection of the projection
modes.

<p>The most promising field of application for this research is the field
of Computer-Aided Geometric Design, for the use of displaying curves
and surfaces in four dimensions.  The wireframe viewer has been used
to view 4D spline curves and has displayed artifacts that were not
obvious with other methods (see figure
<a href="chapter4.html#fig4.15">4.15</a>).

<p>The raytracer written for this research implements the four-sphere, the
four-tetrahedron, and the four-parallelepiped.  It handles point
&amp; directional lighting, reflection, refraction, plus ambient, diffuse
and specular lighting.

<p>The primary catch with four-dimensional raytracing is the fact that the
resulting image is a three-dimensional voxel field, which (for
&ldquo;interesting&rdquo; images) will have a complex internal structure that
is difficult to visualize with current techniques.

<h2 id="s6.2">6.2 Future Research Areas</h2>

<p class="noindent">
There's a lot of room for expansion of the 4D raytracer.  One obvious area
is the inclusion of additional fundamental objects for the raytracer.  As
mentioned earlier, all 4D objects can be represented with a mesh of
tessellating tetrahedra, but this is quite expensive in terms of both storage
and time.  All that is really needed for a new four-dimensional object is an
implicit equation of its hypersurface.  The four-dimensional ray equation can
be plugged into the implicit object equation to yield the equation for the
intersection points.  In the case of multiple intersections, the closest
intersection point is selected.

<p>In addition, the display of the resulting voxel field could well bear some
research.  Most visualization techniques work on a 3D space of scalar data; it
would be useful if some techniques existed to display a 3D field of RGB
data.

<p>The voxel field generated by the raytracer is somewhat different from
other fields more often associated with four-dimensional visualization,
which are often amorphous fields of scalar values.  The output voxel
fields of the raytracer are characterized by the following properties:

<ol>
<li>Internal boundaries are well-defined, corresponding to projected
objects.</li>
<li>There can be quite a lot of different internal solids, often
intersecting.</li>
<li>Each voxel is assigned an RGB triple.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to further understand the 4D images, stereo display techniques for
both the wireframe display and the raytrace output may prove useful.  There
are problems with stereo displays of higher dimensions, primarily the extra
degree of parallax, but there may be ways to solve these.  See
<a href="ref.html#Brisson78">[Brisson 78]</a> for an example of 4D
stereograms.
