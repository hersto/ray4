<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p class="noindent">In appreciation of the time, effort and patience extended
to me in the pursuit of this thesis, I would like to thank my committee
chairman, Dr.  Thomas Foley.  In addition to his guidance in the topic of this
research, he has also been unfailing in helping me get the resources and
information I needed to complete both this research and this paper.  I would
also like to acknowledge and thank Dr. Gregory Nielson and Dr.  Gerald Farin
for being on my thesis committee and offering their observations and
suggestions.

<p>Thanks are also due to Kevin Price for letting me use his Amiga and helping
me produce animations of the raytrace data that aided my understanding of the
process and nature of four-dimensional raytracing.

<p>Finally, I would like to thank my family for their patience, confidence,
enthusiasm and financial support.
